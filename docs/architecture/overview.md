# System Architecture Overview

SwellScope is built as a modular, production-ready platform that provides comprehensive analytics and risk management for Swellchain's restaking ecosystem. This document outlines the high-level architecture and how different components work together.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Modular Design**
- Loosely coupled components that can be developed and deployed independently
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and smart contracts
- Plugin-based architecture for extending functionality

### 2. **Production-Ready**
- No mocks or simulations - all integrations use real deployed contracts
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- Scalable infrastructure designed for institutional use

### 3. **Security-First**
- Multi-layered security approach
- Automated risk management and emergency procedures
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
